            </ul>

           
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                   <li>Prepare the cabbage:
                    Cut the napa cabbage into quarters lengthwise. Remove the core and chop each quarter into bite-sized pieces.
                    Dissolve 1/4 cup of sea salt in 4 cups of water. Submerge the chopped cabbage in the saltwater brine and let it soak for about 1.5 to 2 hours. Stir occasionally to ensure.</li>
                    
                    <li>Rinse and drain the cabbage:
                    After soaking, drain the cabbage and rinse it thoroughly under cold water 2-3 times to remove excess salt. Set aside to drain in a colander.</li>
                    
                    <li>Make the kimchi paste:
                    (Optional) If using rice flour: In a small saucepan, mix 1 tablespoon of glutinous rice flour with 1/2 cup water. Heat over medium heat, stirring until it forms a thick paste. Remove from heat and let it cool.
                    In a large bowl, combine the chili flakes, minced garlic, minced ginger, fish sauce, sugar, and (optional) cooled rice flour paste. Mix well to form the kimchi paste.
                    Add the green onions, carrot, and daikon radish to the paste. Mix until everything is coated.</li>
                    
                    <li>Combine the cabbage and kimchi paste:
                    Add the drained cabbage to the bowl with the kimchi paste. Using your hands (wear gloves to avoid irritation from the chili), mix everything until the cabbage is well coated with the paste.</li>
                    
                    <li>Ferment the kimchi:
                    Pack the kimchi into a clean glass jar, pressing down to remove air pockets. Leave some space at the top as the kimchi will expand during fermentation.
                    Seal the jar loosely (to allow gases to escape) and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days, depending on your desired level of fermentation. It will begin to bubble slightly as it ferments.</li>
                    
                    <li>Store and enjoy:
                    Once fermented to your liking, store the kimchi in the refrigerator. It will continue to develop flavor over time and can be enjoyed for several weeks to months.</li>
