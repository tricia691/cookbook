        <h2>Bulalo</h2>
        <p>Bulalo is a traditional Filipino beef soup made from bone marrow, typically using shank or leg bones. The dish is known for its rich, flavorful broth, which is slow-cooked to extract the marrow from the bones. Vegetables like corn, cabbage, and potatoes are commonly added to the soup, enhancing its hearty and comforting taste. Bulalo is especially popular in the colder regions of the Philippines.</p>
       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare the beef: Rinse the beef shank thoroughly under cold water to remove any impurities.</li>

                <li>Simmer the beef: In a large pot, add the beef shank and cover with 10 cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer. Skim off any scum that rises to the top during the first 10 minutes.<li>
                
                <li>Flavor the broth: Add the quartered onion, garlic (optional), and peppercorns. Cover and let it simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours or until the beef is tender. Add more water if necessary.</li>
                
                <li>Add the vegetables: Once the beef is tender, add the corn and potatoes. Continue simmering until the vegetables are cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Season: Stir in fish sauce or salt to taste. You can adjust the seasoning based on your preference.</li>
                
                <li>Add the greens: Add the pechay (bok choy) or cabbage and green beans (if using) during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. Let them cook just until they are wilted.</li>
                
                <li>Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure to include pieces of beef, marrow, vegetables, and broth. Garnish with green onions if desired.</li>
        </ul>
